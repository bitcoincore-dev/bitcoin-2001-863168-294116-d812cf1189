How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from very old versions of Bitcoin Core or Knots is
possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Bitcoin Knots are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Knots is supported on operating systems using the Linux kernel,
macOS 11.0+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not recommended to use
Bitcoin Knots on unsupported systems.

Known Bugs
==========

In various locations, including the GUI's transaction details dialog and the
"vsize" result in many RPC results, transaction virtual sizes may not account
for an unusually high number of sigops (ie, as determined by the
`-bytespersigop` policy). This could result in reporting a lower virtual size
than is actually used for mempool or mining purposes.

Due to disruption of the shared Bitcoin Transifex repository, this release
still does not include updated translations, and Bitcoin Knots may be unable
to do so until/unless that is resolved.

Notable changes
===============

Node policy changes
-------------------

- A new non-standard token/asset protocol launched a few weeks ago ("Runes").
  Due to its lack of competent review, design flaws (as well as the relative
  worthlessness of the tokens at least when first minted) resulted in it being
  particularly spammy in practice. Some users have chosen to block all
  datacarrier transactions in an effort to mitigate this.

  To better address users' concerns, this release adds a new `-rejecttokens`
  policy filter (also available in the GUI) that will only block Runes
  transactions, thereby enabling users who choose to tolerate datacarrier
  otherwise to re-enable that policy. Note that it is _not_ enabled by
  default at this time.

- Similarly, a new policy filter has been added to block parasitic
  transactions. Many parasite transactions cannot be detected, but this new
  filter aims to do what it can when possible, currently just so-called
  "CAT-21" transactions built using the Ordinal attack. It _is_ enabled by
  default, and can be disabled using `-rejectparasites=0` (or in the GUI) if
  you wish to tolerate these. (knots#78)

- The dust limit has historically required outputs to be at least three times
  the value they provide when later spent. The experimental dynamic adjustment
  function, however, was adjusting it based on exactly (1x) the value the
  output provides. To address this, you can now specify a multiplier by
  prefixing your policy by a number (with up to three decimal places) followed
  by an asterisk. So `-dustdynamic=3.142*target:N` will require outputs to be
  3.142 times the value they provide; or `-dustdynamic=1*target:N` will behave
  the same as previous versions for `target:N`. The default multiplier, if
  none is specified, is now three times as historically has been used. If you
  use this feature, please leave a comment about your experience on GitHub:

Updated RPCs
------------
### Script

- #29853: sign: don't assume we are parsing a sane TapMiniscript

### P2P and network changes

- `submitpackage` now returns results with per-transaction errors rather than
  throwing an exception potentially obscuring other transactions being
  accepted. (#28848)

- `getprioritisedtransactions` now also includes "modified_fee" in results,
  with the sum of the real transaction fee and the fee delta. (#28885)

- `getrawaddrman` has been extended to include in the results for each entry
  "mapped_as" and "source_mapped_as". (#30062)
